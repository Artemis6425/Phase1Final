Exile's First Price Checking Utility! (A Path of Exile Tool)

Program description:

This program retrieves the names and values of multiple different currencies you will find on your journey in Wraeclast. Nessa first greets you, and asks if there's anything she can help with. She'll get the price of the items you tell her you have, and write them down for future use. If you would like to see the value of the items Nessa has checked so far, she will (somewhat) happily do it for you.

Unfortunately, this tool is not very useful if you aren't able to spell the names of the bizarre items you find. However, there will be some items written at the bottom of this README for you to try out the tool.

This tool uses the poe.ninja API to value items. **Values of items fluctuate, as it is an active market.**

Usage:

Make sure to enter "bundle install" in the main folder of the project, then run it with "ruby bin/start". From there, respond to Nessa's questions, and she'll help you value your items.
